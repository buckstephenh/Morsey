# Morsey
Morse Code app written in Swift

2016-07-22 Created initial app

2017-07-73 Fixed the gui update

This app is a starter project to learn Swift and play with APIs. 

Morse Code comes in handy if you are hanging out at the VFW and nobody wants to talk to you.

Encode any string A-Z, 0-9 into US Morse Code per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
by typing string into input field.  Leave field and conversion is executed and displayed while output area flashes.

Ideas: Create a decoder using camera and video processing.  Great for kids passing notes in class.
       Use camera flash instead of output display.  Great if lost on mountain, or flashlight tag.
